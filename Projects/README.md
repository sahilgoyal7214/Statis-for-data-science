### SOLAR  IRRADIANCE  ANALYSIS

Solar Irradiance is the energy per unit time that strikes a unit horizontal area per unit wavelength interval. Analysis of solar irradiance is an essential process for carrying out many day to day applications As solar energy is intermittent in nature, to ensure uninterrupted and reliable power supply to the prosumers, it is essential to forecast the solar irradiance. Accurate solar forecasting is necessary to facilitate large-scale modelling and deployment ofÂ solar system plant .

Incoming solar radiation received from the sun is the primary energy source that drives many of the earth's physical and biological processes. Understanding its importance to landscape scales is key to understanding a broad range of natural processes and human activities. So therefore analysis of Solar irradiance becomes very vital. 

We will be analyzing a numerical dataset of solar irradiance ,ranging from (15May,2020  to  17June,2020) With sampling interval of 15 minutes. Dataset will be comprising of 3183 records and 6 variables, namely DATE_TIME, PLANT_ID, SOURCE_KEY, IRRADIATION,
AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE, MODULE_TEMPERATURE.
This variability has a significant impact on the efficiency of solar energy systems, as well as on the Earth's climate. Understanding solar irradiance is important for predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change, as well as for optimizing the design of solar energy systems.
