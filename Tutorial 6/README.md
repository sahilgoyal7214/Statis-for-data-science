### Problem Statement (Linear Regression in Python)

Humans have greatly associated themselves with Songs & Music. It can improve mood, decrease pain and anxiety, and facilitate opportunities for emotional expression. Research suggests that music can benefit our physical and mental health in numerous ways.
Lately, multiple studies have been carried out to understand songs & their popularity based on certain factors. Such song samples are broken down & their parameters are recorded to tabulate. Predicting the Song Popularity is the main aim.

Use NumPy and Scikit-Learn to predict song popularity and compute the following 

1. Import .csv file using Numpy/Pandas module
2. Identify the best covariate for predicting the song popularity using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient
3. Regression coefficients
4. MSE, RMSE and MAE
5. MAPE
6. Comment on heteroscedasticity 
7. Plot actual vs predicted song popularity on a 2-D graph.
